# Reading Notes - Friday June 10, 2022

*Welcome to your fourth and LAST reading notes file of the week! Reading notes are important because they will help you reinforce what you have learned and help you master the syntax of markdown (which is what I'm writing for you here :D )! The following questions will be for you to answer from the reading and give you a chance to add any thoughts or comments on what you have learned. The more you write, the more you can interpret the concepts you learn* ;)


## HTML:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?

- This type of tag is hardly ever used in HTML, but can be used to make alternative texts.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

- You can always use the "img" tag in order to display the image.

3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.

- I think it helps with displaying an image.

4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

- When you have a gif file, you will have an image that moves while a svg file has a clear background.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
- 
I would use a png to display on a website if I want to give people some type of info on a certain subject.

--------------------------------


## CSS:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)


1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

- When they say foreground, use text-colo and if it's background, use background-color.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up.  How would you use color to give his blog some character?

- Use background color for background and use text-color for text.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

- Use them when you need to style them in a certain way.

4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?

- They all affect the text portion of the CSS.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.

- Use indentation and make sure to use div incase.
